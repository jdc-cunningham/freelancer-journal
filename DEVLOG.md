So I'm short by like $1.5K/mo or about $370/wk

right now I work 4x10s (labor) so I spend my worknights applying to jobs and applying to freelance

I have not landed a job... my last UpWork gig was from 2018

Since then I had been working in some form of tech job W2 eg. front end or software engineer of varying level

UpWork has changed since then... it's like a job takes 8 or 16 connects to apply to and each connect is $0.15 so yeah... just applying costs you money

Anyway this app would give me motivation seeing that number, $370 is not a lot... but it is if you can't land a gig

Also I'll finally take on the drag-drop base64 image to database task via contenteditable html... it's not hard, just have to do it

This is the Medium interface that's nice
